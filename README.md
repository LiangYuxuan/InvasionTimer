# InvasionTimer

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/LiangYuxuan/InvasionTimer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/LiangYuxuan/InvasionTimer)

World of Warcraft addon that provides a datatext showing current and following invasions.

### Realm Supported

* CN

### Help Wanted

If invasion infomation is not available on your realm, this datatext will not be registered and a help-wanted message will be shown in the chat frame.

Currently I only have infomation on CN realm, so if you can help, please [open a ticket](https://github.com/LiangYuxuan/InvasionTimer/issues) about the last time you meet Faction Assault and Legion Invasion, where they took place and your timezone.
